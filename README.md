# Selective Stopping (SeleSt) task

Welcome! SeleSt is an open-source response inhibition task created using Python-integrated PsychoPy software.The task allows response inhibition to be assessed in nonselective and selective stopping contexts, via 1 or 2-choice stop-signal and anticipatory response inhibition paradigms. The key motivation of SeleSt was to create an open-source task with flexible parameters to facilitate investigations of response inhibition across a variety of going and stopping contexts.

Developed by Corey Wadsley* with help from Fenwick Nolan.

NOTE: This is a beta version of the task. Watch this space for an official release!

**Installation:**
- PsychoPy (https://psychopy.org/) is required to run SeleSt. PsychoPy can be installed standalone or within a Python IDE (e.g., Spyder). Instructions for installation can be found on the PsychoPy website. Once installed, the task can be run using the 'SeleSt.py' file

**Current to do:**
- Create instructions (SeleSt_guide)
- Bug test
