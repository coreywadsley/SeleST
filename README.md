# Selective Stopping Toolbox (SeleST)

Welcome! The Selective Stopping Toolbox (SeleST) allows response inhibition to be assessed in nonselective and selective stopping contexts with either stop-signal or anticipatory response inhibition paradigms. SeleST was developed using freely available Python-based PsychoPy software that provides high-quality stimulus and response timing.

Check out the pre-print SeleST article below. Please cite the article if you make use of SeleST.

## General information

- [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/) is required for SeleST. PsychoPy can be installed standalone or within a Python IDE (e.g., Spyder). Instructions for installation can be found on the PsychoPy website. Once installed, the task can be run using the 'SeleST.py' file.

- SeleST makes use of the object-oriented basis of Python. Most parameters can be modified using a graphical user interface (GUI) presented whenever SeleST is run (below). Advanced users can also insert modified versions of the various functions that handle specific aspects of the task. The default options of SeleST support use simple or choice variants of multicomponent SST and ARI pardigms.
